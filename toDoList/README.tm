# Overview

C++ is an object-oriented language used for embedded systems and application development. It builds on C and requires a compiler and linker specific to your OS and processor. This project is a console-based To-Do List Manager that demonstrates core C++ features such as like variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and STL.

# Development Environment

I used Xcode on macOS.(had to use Xcode for the compiler) The project is written in C++ and uses:
- **iostream** for I/O
- **vector** for dynamic arrays
- **fstream** and **sstream** for file operations
- **string** for text manipulation

# Unique Requirements & Stretch Challenges

This project meets the following requirements:
- Demonstrates core C++ features:
1.variables
2.expressions
3.conditionals
4.loops
5.functions
6.classes

- Uses an STL data structure

Stretch challenges include:
- Adding file I/O for saving and loading tasks
- Using inheritance with virtual functions
- Managing objects with new and delete

# Future Work

Future improvements:
- Enhance file I/O for persistent task storage
- Allow editing of tasks
- Explore more C++ features like inheritance and dynamic memory management
